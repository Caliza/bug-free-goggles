## Regex Components

### Anchors
In Regex anchors have a particular meaning. They do not match a specific character; they match a position before and after the characters. The ^ matches the beging of a text and the $ matches the end of a text.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers ,signified with {n}, {n,m}, or {n,}, match the number of instances any character, group, or character class appear in a string. In the email [a-z\.]{2,6} indicates that the letters [a-z] match 2 to 6 times.
